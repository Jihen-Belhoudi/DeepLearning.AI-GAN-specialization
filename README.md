## About GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful machine learning models capable of generating realistic outputs such as images, videos, and voices. Rooted in game theory, GANs find applications in diverse fields, from cybersecurity and privacy preservation to image generation, colorization, resolution enhancement, avatar creation, and more.

As computing power has advanced, GANs have become increasingly popular, enabling the generation of large datasets for training machine learning models and producing sharper and more accurate outputs.

## About this Specialization
